See the README one level up about where to find the reference manual
and schematics for the board.

Derived from blinker04, multiplies external crystal to 96MHz.
Uart baud rate is divided down from that.

This example writes a 0x55 ("U") and 0x56 ("V") to the port, one per
second, so the output is UVUVUVUVU...
115200 8N1

//UART baud rate = UART module clock / (16 × divisor)
//divisor = UART module clock / (16 × baud)
//96000000/(16*baud) = 52.08 = 0x34
//.08 * 32 = 2.56 so we want a fraction of 3

//what if we thought in terms of 32nds of a divisor rather than the divisor
//divisor32 = (UART module clock / (16 × baud)) * 32
//divisor32 = (UART module clock * 2) / baud
//divisor32 = 96000000 * 2 / 115200 = 1666.6
//round up
//divisor32 = 1667 = 0x683
//011010000011
//0110100 00011
//divisor of 0x34 with a remainder of 3
//fraction is divisor32 & 0x1F
//lower 8 bits of divisor = (divisor32 >> 5)&0xFF
//upper 5 bits of divisor = (divisor32 >> 13)&0x1F
